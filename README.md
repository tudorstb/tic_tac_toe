# tic_tac_toe
This is my attempt at re-creating the classic game tic_tac_toe 

Besides the base game i created :
-the option to play in two 
-a "Play against bot" game mode in witch you can play in single-player agains a random generator for the oppositions choose
-the option to choose if you want to play with "o" or "x" when playing against a bot
-the program will request from you to re-enter a position choosen if it is already occupied
